<h3>CTS 1.0</h3>
<p>The first version of CTS contains the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Three workflows for predicting speciation, physicochemical properties, and transformation pathways of organic chemicals. Each workflow has a single or batch mode, where the former is a more graphically-oriented method for getting information for a given chemical, while batch mode is able to run a list of up to 10 chemicals at a time.</li>
<li>Four modules that are used within the above workflows: Chemical Editor (CE), Chemical Speciation (CS), Physicochemical Properties (PCP), and Reaction Pathway Simulator (RPS).</li>
<li>Four physicochemical property calculators, which are EPI Suite, ChemAxon, TEST, and OPERA</li>
<li>Three reaction pathways used for predicting transformation pathways: Abiotic Hydrolysis (version 1.7), Abiotic Reduction (version 1.4), and Human Phase 1 Metabolism library.</li>
<li>CSV, PDF, and HTML file downloads for chemical data for all workflows in the single mode, and CSV file downloads for batch mode.</li>
<li>A set of API endpoints and documentation for other apps/developers to be able to access CTS features programmatically.</li>
</ul>

<h3>CTS 1.1</h3>
<p>CTS version 1.1 contains the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Updated hydrolysis library to version 1.8</li>
<li>Updated abiotic reduction library to version 1.5</li>
<li>OPERA physicochemical calculator pH dependent log K<sub>OW</sub>/logD</li>
<li>Added unranked photolysis reaction library version 1.0</li>
<li>Added ranked photolysis reaction library version 1.3</li>
<li>Reaction pathways in Reaction Pathway Simulator (RPS) link to corresponding documentation</li>
<li>Added BioTransformer - a computational tool for the prediction of small molecule metabolism, and metabolite identification</li>
</ul>

<h3>CTS 1.2</h3>
<p>The following updates are included in the CTS version 1.2 release:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implemented Ketcher chemical structure editor as the new drawing tool in the Chemical Editor</li>
<li>Added linkage to EnviPath for predicted products due to microbial biotransformations under aerobic conditions</li>
<li>Modified options for selecting reaction libraries to incorporate predictions from EnviPath, Biotransformer, and CTS direct photolysis library</li>
<li>Added version number to webpage header</li>
</ul>

<h3>CTS 1.3</h3>
<p>CTS version 1.3 contains the following new features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added CTS reaction libraries to predict environmental and metabolic transformations of PFAS chemicals</li>
<li>Added documentation on the Reaction Libraries page to describe the algorithm for predicting likely transformation products using “production” and “accumulation” values</li>
<li>Updated source code for BioTransformer and OPERA to resolve log4j security vulnerabilities</li>
<li>Modified the Chemical Editor to retrieve chemical identification information from the new CCTE API due to the deprecation of the ACToRWS web services</li>
</ul>
