<p>
CTS Reaction Libraries are composed of generalized reaction schemes that that specify how a molecular fragment will be modified by a particular transformation process (e.g., abiotic hydrolysis, abiotic reduction, and mammalian metabolism). The reaction schemes were developed based on reported transformation pathways and products from the peer-reviewed literature and regulatory reports. The reaction libraries are considered to be comprehensive based on review of the current literature; however, updates will be made as additional studies are published.

<h3>Prediction of Transformation Pathways</h3>
<p>
When a user submits a molecule of interest in the CTS Generate Transformation Products workflow, CTS compares the molecule to the reactant side of each scheme within the Reaction Library. If CTS finds a match between a structural fragment within the molecule and the reactant side of a scheme, it modifies the fragment according to the scheme, leaving the rest of the molecule unchanged. Because a molecule may contain multiple structural fragments that match the reactant side of different reaction schemes, multiple products can be generated from the parent molecule. To predict which of these products are the most likely to accumulate, CTS calculates the &#34;production&#34; and &#34;accumulation&#34; of each product using an integer rank that has been assigned to each reaction scheme within the CTS Reaction Libraries based on reported transformation rates in the scientific literature.

<h3>Direct Photolysis Reaction Library</h3>
<p>
There are currently 154 reaction schemes in the Direct Photolysis Reaction Library.
There are ranked and unranked versions of the library. The unranked library generates
all possible phototransformation products and should not be run with other libraries.
In the documentation pages for the ranked and unranked libraries, left click a reaction
scheme to view the generalized reaction scheme, supporting reaction rules for
reactivity, selectivity and exclusion, as well as example transformation pathways and
associated references. Scroll to the bottom of the ranked library documentation page

<h3>Spontaneous Reaction Library</h3>
<p>
The Spontaneous Reaction Library contains aqueous reactions that occur very quickly
and is intended to be combined with other CTS reaction libraries. It was developed to
capture the rapid transformation of intermediates that form due to other
transformation processes (e.g., hydrolysis or photolysis). The current version of
Spontaneous Reaction Library contains one reaction scheme.

<h3>Human Phase 1 Metabolism Reaction Library</h3>
<p>
The Human Phase 1 Metabolism Reaction Library contains 159 reaction schemes
based on cytochrome P450 (CYP450) phase one biotransformations. This reaction
library was developed by ChemAxon. The reaction library is proprietary, so details of
the reaction schemes cannot be viewed.

<h3>Biotransformer Metabolism API</h3>
<p>
BioTransformer is a software tool that predicts small molecule metabolism in mammals, their gut microbiota, as well as the soil/aquatic microbiota. Moreover, it can also assist scientists in the identification of metabolites, which is based on the metabolism prediction. BioTransformer uses both a knowledge-based approach and a machine learning based approach to predict small molecules metabolism. In particular, BioTransformer consists of five independent modules: EC-based, CYP450, Phase II, Human Gut Microbial and Environmental Microbial.
