<p>This workflow allows the user to predict transformation products predicted base on the selection and execution of the reaction libraries that encode the process science for transformation processes.  The user has the option to enter an individual chemical through the Chemical Editor or through batch mode (select Batch tab).  Entry into the Reaction Pathway Simulator will allow the user select the reaction library of interest based on the selection of reaction conditions. </p>
